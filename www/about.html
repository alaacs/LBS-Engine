  <p class="centered">
    There are many possible reasons for people to give things away for free: disuse of products, donation due to surplus, just through plain solidarity and many more.
    Geofreebie is an location-based mobile application that helps users find or donate gifts more easily by visualising items on a map. The app provides a map and list display
    of app users and offered items. Furthermore, the GeoFreebie can track users and notify them about gifts in their current vicinity. Gifters can add their donation data
    without giving their exact location, protecting their privacy. Have fun hunting freebies!
