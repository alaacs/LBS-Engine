  <h1 align="center">GeoFreebie</h1>
  <p align="center">There are many possible reasons for people to give things away for free: disuse of products, donation due to surplus, just through plain solidarity and many more.
     Geofreebie is an location-based mobile application that helps users find/donate gifts more easily by visualising items on a map. The app provides a spatial search engine
     for users to search for free items. Furthermroe, the GeoFreebie can track users and notify them about gifts in their current vicinity. Gifters can upload their donation data
     without giving their exact location, protecting their privacy. Have fun hunting freebies!</p>
