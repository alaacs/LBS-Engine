1. As a user I want to find nearby offers so that I can pick one up.

    - Look at list, sorted by distance (show distance in list)
    - Click on desired offer
    - See freecycler with contact info on the map

2. As a freecycler, I want to update my info on the map so that I can give something away.

    - Click button on the About screen
    - Enter contact info and offer description in the form provided

3. As a user, I want to be notified when I am near to something being given away, so that I can find things I want without looking for them.

    - Turn on notifications in the settings panel
    - See notification when a offer is nearby (definition of nearby TBD)
    - Click on the notification to be taken to the map view with contact info for the freecycler

4. As a user, I want to be able to choose how close I should be to an object to be notified, so that I'm not bothered constantly when I'm too far away.
