# Free stuff website
_Mission: encourage reuse of discarded items_

### Initial thoughts
- Find free food or furniture near your current location
  - Or on your route
- Rate the gifters (trustworthy, high quality stuff?)
- Two languages?
- Scrape existing sites?
- Suggestions based on usual routes
- Cost of getting there (gas, time)
- Different travel modes

### Sugestions from Kray
- Opportunistic management/sharing
- What's the morality?
- How to decided who get's it?
- Talk to Ana Maria Bustamante Duarte (researches refugees) and Mehrnaz Ataei (privacy morality)
